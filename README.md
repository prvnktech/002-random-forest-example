# Mobile Ads Purchase Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a user will purchase a mobile ad based on certain features. It uses machine learning models, including a neural network, a random forest classifier, and an XGBoost classifier for prediction.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- xgboost

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow xgboost
```

## Getting Started


## Datasets
The project uses the "mobile_ads.csv" dataset. The dataset includes information about users and their interactions with mobile ads.

## Models

- ### Neural Network
- ### Random Forest Classifier
- ### XGBoost Classifier


## Results

- The neural network achieved a test accuracy of 86.60.
- The random forest classifier achieved a test accuracy of 87.50.
- The XGBoost classifier achieved the highest test accuracy of **<p style="color: red;">88.75</p>**.

## Conclusion

Based on the results, the XGBoost classifier performed the best in predicting mobile ad purchases.
